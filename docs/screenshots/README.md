# Screenshot TODOs

Screenshots are intentionally placeholder-only until local capture is performed.

Expected image files in this folder:
- `runs-table.png`
- `new-run-form.png`
- `run-detail-charts.png`
- `dashboard.png` (optional)

## Suggested capture steps

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Open these routes in a browser:
   - `/runs`
   - `/runs/new`
   - `/runs/RUN-101`
   - `/dashboard` (optional)
3. Capture viewport screenshots at desktop width (~1440px).
4. Save images in this folder using the expected names.
5. Update README image section if you want inline embeds.
